# Neural Architecture Search-Driven Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Drug Response Prediction

## Overview üìñ
This repository contains the implementation of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques for optimizing deep learning models in drug response prediction. Accurate drug response prediction is crucial for personalized medicine, reducing adverse effects, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Traditional deep learning models rely on manually designed architectures, which may fail to capture the complexity of drug interactions. The project evaluates different NAS approaches, including Random Search, Q-Learning, and Bayesian Optimization, to improve the predictive accuracy of drug response models,  supporting advancements in personalized medicine and drug development. The findings demonstrate that NAS-optimized models outperform conventional deep learning approaches. The results indicate the potential of NAS in predictive modeling for drug response and its implications in personalized medicine and drug development.

## Results

| Method                 | MSE     | R¬≤       | MAE     | RMSE    |
|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Random Search         | 0.096292 | -0.003099 | 0.27427 | 0.310309 |
| Q-Learning           | **0.065483** | **0.116831** | **0.20684** | **0.255897** |
| Bayesian Optimization | 0.092374 | -0.069800 | 0.25340 | 0.303931 |

**Key Findings:**
- **Q-Learning performed best**, achieving the lowest error rates and highest R¬≤ score.
- **Bayesian Optimization showed moderate performance**, improving over Random Search but underperforming compared to Q-Learning.
